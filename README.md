# factorio-uraniumrework
a factorio mod - uranium rework

makes uranium processing both easy and difficult at the same time. 

Uranium in real life creates waste that cannot be disposed of easily. in game it shall be like that. you can make use of uranium but it shall create waste. There is an expensive way of doing it in game (sending to space).
